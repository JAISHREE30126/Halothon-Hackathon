# Halothon-Hackathon
Here our team have won the hackathon by detecting the blood chambers in all frames of an echo video, given the contour of the chamber in the first frame.
An echo of heart is a video consisting of multiple frames of a beating heart. The video will shows one full cycle of a beating heart from diastole (fully expanded) to systole (fully contracted) to diastole again. The heart has four chambers but only 2, 3 or 4 chambers may be visible in one video. We have identified one of the chambers automatically. The boundary (contour) of the chamber in the first frame is given. The boundary lies at the point of maximum intensity change (perpendicular to the boundary) around the chamber. As the heart expands and contracts, the boundary also grow and shrink so that points on the contour lie at the point of maximum intensity change and  also we have maintained smoothness of the boundary (it is not zig-zag). The problem is to adjust the boundary, given in the first frame, for all subsequent frames in the video by satisfying the criteria required. The result is shown in  the video with the frames superimposed in all the frames.
